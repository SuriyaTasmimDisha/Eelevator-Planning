## Using PDDL to Design an Efficient Elevator Control System.

### About

There is a building with 9 floors. The building has 1 fast (accelerating) elevator that stops at all the floors. The fast elevator has a capacity of 7 persons. Furthermore, there are 3 slow elevators, that stop only at the floors unique to them. Each slow elevator has a capacity of 10 persons. The Fast elevator is allocated for the teachers and the slow ones are allocated for the students. Each slow elevator has a special feature that offers a passenger a nonstop trip to his destination. This feature can be used by a disabled or an important person. Also, this feature can be used in case of any emergency need. There are costs associated with each elevator. The planning problem is to find a plan that moves the elevators to passengers' destinations and minimizes total cost.
