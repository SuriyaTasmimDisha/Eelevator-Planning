## Using PDDL to Design an Efficient Elevator Control System.

### About

A building with 9 floors has 2 fast (accelerating) elevators that stop at all the floors. Furthermore, there are 2 slow elevators. One slow elevator stops only at the even floors and other one stops only at the odd floors. Each elevator has a capacity of 10 persons. One fast elevator is allocated only for the teachers and the other elevators are allocated for the general users. The fast elevator that is allocated for the general users has a special feature that offers a passenger a nonstop trip to his destination. This feature can be used by a disabled or an important person. Also, this feature can be used in case of any emergency need. There are costs associated with each elevator. The cost associated with fast elevators is higher than slow elevators. Our planning problem is to find a plan that moves the elevators to passengers' destinations and minimizes total cost.
