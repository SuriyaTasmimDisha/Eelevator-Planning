### About

There is a building with 9 floors, numbered from 0 to 8. The building has 1 fast (accelarating) elevator that stop at all the floors. The fast elevator has a capacity of 7 persons. Furthermore, there are 3 slow elevators, that stop only at the floors unique to them. Each slow elevator has a capacity of 10 persons. Fast elevators are allocated for the teachers and slow ones are allocated for the students. Each slow elevator has a special feature called Nonstop Travel. This feature offers a passenger nonstop trip to his destinaton. There are costs associated with each elevator. Planning problem is to find a plan that moves the elevators to passengers destinations and minimizes total cost.
